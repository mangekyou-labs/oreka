# ICP Prediction Market Layer 🎯

A decentralized binary options trading platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), allowing users to make price direction predictions on cryptocurrency pairs.

## Overview 🌟

The Binary Options Market is a proof-of-concept prediction market that leverages ICP's infrastructure to create a transparent and decentralized trading environment. Users can participate by predicting whether an asset's price will go up or down within a specified timeframe.

### Key Features
- 📈 Resolved with price feeds via HTTP Outcalls
- ⚡ 30-second trading windows
- 🎲 Entire-pool reward/loss per correct/incorrect prediction
- 🔒 Secure identity management via Internet Identity
- 💱 Support for multiple cryptocurrency pairs
- 🏭 Factory canister for deploying custom markets

## Architecture 📐

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Factory Canister** (`canisters/factory/`)
   - Creates and manages binary option market canisters
   - Allows customization of trading pairs and fees
   - Tracks deployed markets by owner
   - Manages canister lifecycle

2. **Binary Option Market Canister** (`canisters/binary_option_market/`)
   - Core trading/managing logic
   - HTTP Outcalls for price feeds based on trading pairs
   - State management
   - Account management
   - Support for customizable fees
   - Public resolveMarket function

3. **Frontend** (`icp-asset/`)
   - React/Next.js interface
   - Internet Identity integration
   - Real-time updates
   - Market creation and management UI

### Factory Canister Architecture

The Factory Canister serves as the central hub for creating and managing Binary Option Markets. It provides the following capabilities:

x#### Key Components

1. **Market Deployment**
   - Creates customizable prediction markets with:
     - Custom trading pairs (e.g., "ICP-USD", "BTC-USD")
     - Customizable fee structures
     - Configurable maturity times
     - Unique strike prices

2. **Contract Management**
   - Tracks all deployed contracts
   - Filters contracts by owner
   - Manages canister settings and controllers

3. **Events Tracking**
   - Records deployment events
   - Maintains historical market creation data

#### Data Structures

- `Contract`: Stores metadata about each deployed market
- `ContractType`: Categorizes different types of contracts
- `DeployEvent`: Records market creation events

#### Deployment Flow

1. User calls `deployMarket` with parameters
2. Factory creates a new canister
3. Factory installs Binary Option Market code with provided parameters
4. Factory sets controllers for the new canister
5. Factory records the new market in its registry

## Technical Stack 🛠

- **Backend**: Motoko
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Chakra UI
- **Identity**: Internet Identity
- **Price Feeds**: HTTP Outcalls
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
- dfx CLI
- Node.js >= 14
- NPM

### Local Development

1. Start the local replica:

```bash
cd oreka/

dfx start --clean
```

2. Deploy the Factory and Binary Option Market canister:

```bash
export MINTER=$(dfx --identity anonymous identity get-principal)
export DEFAULT=$(dfx identity get-principal)

# deploy icp_ledger_canister dependency first
dfx deploy icp_ledger_canister --argument "(variant { Init =
record {
     token_symbol = \"ICRC1\";
     token_name = \"L-ICRC1\";
     minting_account = record { owner = principal \"${MINTER}\" };
     transfer_fee = 10_000;
     metadata = vec {};
     initial_balances = vec { record { record { owner = principal \"${DEFAULT}\"; }; 10_000_000_000; }; };
     archive_options = record {
         num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
         trigger_threshold = 2000;
         controller_id = principal \"${MINTER}\";
     };
     feature_flags = opt record {
         icrc2 = true;
     };
 }
})"

# transfer ICP to player
dfx canister call icp_ledger_canister icrc1_transfer "(record {
  to = record {
    owner = principal \"${DEFAULT}\";
  };
  amount = 1_000_000_000;
})"

# deploy factory canister
dfx deploy factory

# (Optional) Deploy a test market directly for testing
dfx deploy binary_option_market --argument '(12.0, 1743880750, "ICP-USD", 10)'

# optional: deploy test canister
dfx deploy binary_option_market_test
dfx canister call binary_option_market_test test
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
# deploy the internet identity
dfx deps deploy

cd icp-asset
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

4. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Creating a Market

You can create a new market through the factory canister with:

```bash
dfx canister call factory deployMarket '("My Market", 12.0, 3600000000000, 10, "ICP-USD")'
```

Parameters:
- `"My Market"`: Market name
- `12.0`: Strike price (float)
- `3600000000000`: Maturity time in nanoseconds (1 hour)
- `10`: Fee percentage (10%)
- `"ICP-USD"`: Trading pair

## Deployment Backend API

The project now includes a dedicated API for automating the deployment of WASM modules to created canisters. This eliminates the need to manually run the `deploy-market.sh` script after creating a market.

### Running the Deployment API

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the API server:
   ```
   npm run start:api
   ```

3. For development with auto-reload:
   ```
   npm run dev:api
   ```

The API server runs on port 3001 by default. You can change this by setting the `API_PORT` environment variable.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/deploy/market` - Deploy WASM to a market canister
  - Body parameters:
    - `canisterId` - The canister ID to deploy to
    - `strikePrice` - The strike price for the market
    - `maturityTimestamp` - The maturity timestamp in seconds
    - `feePercentage` - The fee percentage (0-100)
    - `tradingPair` - The trading pair (default: ICP-USD)
- `GET /api/deploy/status/:canisterId` - Check deployment status of a canister

### Configuration

Configure the frontend to use the API by setting these environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/deploy
```

Built with ❤️ for the Internet Computer ecosystem.

# Oreka Factory Canister

## Cycles Requirements

The Factory canister requires a sufficient amount of cycles to deploy and operate binary option markets:

- **Factory Canister Operation**: The factory canister itself must maintain at least **2.2T cycles** to function properly
- **Market Deployment Cost**: Each binary option market deployment requires **4T cycles** to ensure successful creation and initialization
- **Total Cost (worst case)**: 4.4T cycles (2.2T for factory operation + 2.2T for market deployment)
- **ICP Equivalent**: Approximately 1.32 ICP (at current conversion rate of 0.3 ICP = 1T cycles)

### Important Notes:
- Always ensure the factory canister has more than the required cycles before attempting to create a new market
- If you encounter an "out of cycles" error, you need to top up the factory canister
- The exact cycle consumption may vary slightly depending on market parameters and network conditions
- For safety, consider allocating extra cycles beyond the minimum requirements
